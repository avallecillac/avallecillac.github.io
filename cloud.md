# "The Cloud" in human words

As a **Cloud Engineer** I struggle every day trying to explain to non-tech friends and family what I do
at work. I've been trying -unsuccessfully- to explain during my 10 years of career, and they always leave the
room either more confused or still believing I only fix printers and format computers (Even though I do format
computers every now and then ðŸ˜œ). So, I thought on finding a more "human" way to explain it.

We are about to start reading a lot of new words that might sound too technical, so letÂ´s use a metaphor to smooth things up.

1. DataCenter = Fridge (Yes, the fridge from your house).
2. Computers/Servers = Compartments of the fridge.
3. Applications = Food stored in the compartments.

- The fridge keeps the ideal temperature to preserve the food inside. 
  **Datacenter** is a large warehouse full of racks with powerful computers. Just like your laptop, these super computers can heat up and eventually break, so proper refrigeration is required to keep them stable.
- Compartments have different sizes and some even a lid for long preservation.
  **Computers/Servers** have different design, specifications and operating systems to host different types of applications.
- Food is organized in the compartments based on their type: Fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, etc.
  **Applications** are programs installed in computers. And these are the ones you interact with every day of your life from your smartphones and computers. Believe or not, these application like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Google are all installed in the super computers and datacenters described above.

I hope you are still with me. Now, lets put these concepts in practice and see how they will become **"The Cloud"** and how it impacts us.

Let's say you just got your first place and bought a fridge.
Before I dive deeper into this **cloudy** topic, let's first understand how this new buzzword became a trend.
