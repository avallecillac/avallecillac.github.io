Blog adventure that aims to explain tech for humans kindly

As a **Cloud Engineer** I struggle every day trying to explain to non-tech friends and family what I do
at work. I've been trying -unsuccessfully- to explain during my 10 years of career, and they always leave the
room either more confused or still believing I only fix printers and format computers (Even though I do format
computers every now and then ðŸ˜œ). So, I thought on finding a more "human" way to explain it.
